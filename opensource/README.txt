Description: 
    Sample color -> Make binary representation -> Get biggest contour --> Dismiss contours
    not representing hands --> Describe contours with convex polygons and find convexity defects
    --> Filter out irrelevant polygon information
Test result:
    Not reliable when hand contour is not connected. Good binary representation is crucial. May work
better with depth-camera.
